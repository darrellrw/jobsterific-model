Summary        :
Work is an economic activity carried out by individuals with the aim of earning income or profit. The employee recruitment process is crucial for companies because the right employees significantly contribute to the company's success. According to data from the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency (BPS), there are 138.63 million working-age individuals in Indonesia, with 138.63 million employed and 7.99 million unemployed.  The Ministry of National Development Planning (Kementerian PPN/Bappenas) is formulating the National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN) 2025-2045 to support the realization of Indonesia's Golden Vision 2045, aiming to make Indonesia a "Sovereign, Advanced, and Sustainable Archipelagic State." In order to achieve this, Indonesia must reduce the high unemployment rate that still exists in the year 2023.

To facilitate both companies and job seekers, especially the unemployed, we have developed an application designed to match job descriptions provided by companies with the resumes of job seekers. This application conducts keyword searches to find relevant keywords between company job descriptions and information in job seekers' resumes. This streamlines the initial selection process, enabling companies to evaluate candidates who meet their predefined criteria more efficiently.

Furthermore, the application offers flexibility for companies to perform further selection based on their own methods, allowing them to find employees who truly align with the company's needs and values. Therefore, this application is expected to simplify and expedite the employee recruitment process while enhancing accuracy in selecting the most suitable candidates for the offered positions.

We embarked on this project with the primary goal of creating an application that can match CVs or resumes of job seekers with the recruitment needs of companies. Our aim is to bridge the gap that often exists between the job descriptions provided by companies and the information present in job seekers' resumes. Therefore, we strive to assist companies in finding employees that align with their requirements while offering support to job seekers, especially the unemployed, in showcasing their skills and qualifications more effectively.

With this background, our team of experts in Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Mobile Development saw an opportunity to create an innovative solution that can solve this problem. We believe that with the right technology, we can help companies make initial selection more efficient and accurate, while giving job seekers a better chance of getting a job that suits their abilities.

In our efforts to achieve Indonesia Emas 2045, we believe that our contribution to simplifying and expediting the employee recruitment process while enhancing accuracy in candidate selection is a positive step towards improving efficiency and productivity in the world of work. That's why our team is passionately and confidently tackling this project.
